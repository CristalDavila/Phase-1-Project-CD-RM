Today you'll be learning about how awesome Denver, Colorado is. You will be learning about a few of the many things that Denver has to offer you. If you are new to Denver, then take a look around our website and get some ideas of activities that you would like to do.

## Setup

We set this website up because we wanted to show some of the many cool things in Denver. In our website we have five different categories that show some activities that are located in the city. We also decided that we wanted to be able to add a "My Plans" section for yourself.

Run this command to checkout the backend:

```console
$ json-server --watch db.json
```

Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:

[http://localhost:3000/activities](http://localhost:3000/activities)

Then, open the `index.html` file on your browser to run the application.

Our code is in the `src/index.js` file. The base URL for your API will be
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Closing

I hope you enjoyed the website and below is a map of Denver!
